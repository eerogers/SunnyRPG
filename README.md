To Play: Select a Character for your avatar, then attack each of the other characters until you've either defeated everyone or you've lost. If you defeat all opponents, your avatar will win Paddy's Pub. If you lose, the opponent who beat you will win the bar. If you and your opponent knock each other out simultanously, the contest will be judged a stalemate and you should try again.
